# illumio-coding-challenge

To test my code I created a local csv file with the testing rules given on the coding assignemnt pdf that illumio sent me. I don't have enough time to write out a more thorough tests to test on edge cases. If I had more time, I would try to write out testers that run through the entire code to check if I would actually get the desired outcome. Furthermore, I usually run a code coverage report when I was working on my own projects to make sure that my code is efficient and doesn't contain redundant lines.

An interesting thing when I was planning out the structure of the code was that I wasn't planning on having so many helper classes/enums but ended up having quite a few. In fact, I could've combined many of them into one file, but then I realized that separating them might be the way to go. I find this interesting because even though I have used java to do many coding assignment in school, seeing how this object-oriented property of java fits in real-life application is just amazing.

If I had more time, here are some things that I would've done. First, there must be something in my code that can be optimized. Secondly, I would have added more comments throughout my code. I usually wrote comments during the process of coding instead of doing them after, but due to the time constraints I wasn't able to do much. 

Finally, I would like the reviewer to know that I am really intersted in what illumio is doing and really hope I can join as an intern and possibly get a return offer after I graduate. I am very passionate and an easy-going person to work with, please give me the chance to work on something cool with illumio!

My preference for the team would be 1. Data Team 2. Platform Team 3. Policy Team. However, I would like to let the reviewer know that all three of them look interesting to me! The reason for the ranking is that what the data team is doing looks the most intuitive to me. Another reason for the ranking is that in case the teams have to pick applicants based on their rankings.

Thank you!
